Automating VM starting and login with ssh in fedora 22

I am using my fedora-22 and I was running a Ubuntu-14.04.04 LTS server on my VM. Each time before starting my Ubuntu I had to open my VM maneger (Virtual Machine Manager-1.2.1 powered by libvirt) and then do SSH from my fedora terminal. 

I wanted to get a easy solution for it. Like a shell script command. That I will run it and the shell script do my job.

I this repository i am going to share my solution.
